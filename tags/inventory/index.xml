In order to find a particular item, we decided to setup a partkeepr instance.
The project is on github : https://github.com/ko-lab/partkeepr
This particular instance is set up in a docker container. It is started up with docker compose together with a database container. This makes it easy to reinstall from a reference when needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
